Help on class ELFFile in module elftools.elf.elffile:

class ELFFile(builtins.object)
 |  ELFFile(stream, stream_loader=None)
 |
 |  Creation: the constructor accepts a stream (file-like object) with the
 |  contents of an ELF file.
 |
 |  Optionally, a stream_loader function can be passed as the second
 |  argument. This stream_loader function takes a relative file path to
 |  load a supplementary object file, and returns a stream suitable for
 |  creating a new ELFFile. Currently, the only such relative file path is
 |  obtained from the supplementary object files.
 |
 |  Accessible attributes:
 |
 |      stream:
 |          The stream holding the data of the file - must be a binary
 |          stream (bytes, not string).
 |
 |      elfclass:
 |          32 or 64 - specifies the word size of the target machine
 |
 |      little_endian:
 |          boolean - specifies the target machine's endianness
 |
 |      elftype:
 |          string or int, either known value of E_TYPE enum defining ELF
 |          type (e.g. executable, dynamic library or core dump) or integral
 |          unparsed value
 |
 |      header:
 |          the complete ELF file header
 |
 |      e_ident_raw:
 |          the raw e_ident field of the header
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __enter__(self)
 |
 |  __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
 |  __getitem__(self, name)
 |      Implement dict-like access to header entries
 |
 |  __init__(self, stream, stream_loader=None)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  address_offsets(self, start, size=1)
 |      Yield a file offset for each ELF segment containing a memory region.
 |
 |      A memory region is defined by the range [start...start+size). The
 |      offset of the region is yielded.
 |
 |  close(self)
 |
 |  get_dwarf_info(self, relocate_dwarf_sections=True, follow_links=True)
 |      Return a DWARFInfo object representing the debugging information in
 |      this file.
 |
 |      If relocate_dwarf_sections is True, relocations for DWARF sections
 |      are looked up and applied.
 |
 |      If follow_links is True, we will try to load the external and/or supplementary
 |      object file (if any), and use it to resolve references and imports.
 |
 |  get_dwarf_link(self)
 |      Read the .gnu_debuglink section, return an object with filename (as bytes) and checksum (as number) in it.
 |
 |  get_ehabi_infos(self)
 |      Generally, shared library and executable contain 1 .ARM.exidx section.
 |      Object file contains many .ARM.exidx sections.
 |      So we must traverse every section and filter sections whose type is SHT_ARM_EXIDX.
 |
 |  get_machine_arch(self)
 |      Return the machine architecture, as detected from the ELF header.
 |
 |  get_section(self, n, type=None)
 |      Get the section at index #n from the file (Section object or a
 |      subclass)
|  get_shstrndx(self)
 |      Find the string table section index for the section header table
 |
 |  get_supplementary_dwarfinfo(self, dwarfinfo)
 |      Read supplementary dwarfinfo, from either the standared .debug_sup
 |      section, the GNU proprietary .gnu_debugaltlink, or .gnu_debuglink.
 |
 |  has_dwarf_info(self, strict=False)
 |      Check whether this file appears to have debugging information.
 |      We assume that if it has the .debug_info or .zdebug_info section, it
 |      has all the other required sections as well.
 |
 |      Unless you pass strict=True, the presence of .eh_frame section,
 |      which is DWARF adjacent but hardly DWARF proper, will count as debug info.
 |      Stripped files contain .eh_frame but none of the .[z]debug_xxx sections.
 |
 |  has_dwarf_link(self)
 |      Whether the binary's debug info is in an
 |      external file. Use get_dwarf_link to retrieve the path to it.
 |
 |  has_ehabi_info(self)
 |      Check whether this file appears to have arm exception handler index table.
 |
 |  has_phantom_bytes(self)
 |      The XC16 compiler for the PIC microcontrollers emits DWARF where all odd bytes in all DWARF sections
 |      are to be discarded ("phantom").
 |
 |       We don't know where does the phantom byte discarding fit into the usual chain of section content transforms.
 |       There are no XC16/PIC binaries in the corpus with relocations against DWARF, and the DWARF section compression
 |       seems to be unsupported by XC16.
 |
 |  has_section(self, section_name)
 |      Section existence check by name, without the overhead of parsing if found.
 |
 |  iter_sections(self, type=None)
 |      Yield all the sections in the file. If the optional |type|
 |      parameter is passed, this method will only yield sections of the
 |      given type. The parameter value must be a string containing the
 |      name of the type as defined in the ELF specification, e.g.
 |      'SHT_SYMTAB'.
 |
 |  iter_segments(self, type=None)
|  iter_segments(self, type=None)
 |      Yield all the segments in the file. If the optional |type|
 |      parameter is passed, this method will only yield segments of the
 |      given type. The parameter value must be a string containing the
 |      name of the type as defined in the ELF specification, e.g.
 |      'PT_LOAD'.
 |
 |  num_sections(self)
 |      Number of sections in the file
 |
 |  num_segments(self)
 |      Number of segments in the file

 |  Class methods defined here:
 |
 |  load_from_path(path)
 |      Takes a path to a file on the local filesystem, and returns an
 |      ELFFile from it, setting up a correct stream_loader relative to the
 |      original file.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods defined here:
 |
 |  make_relative_loader(base_path)
 |      Return a function that takes a potentially relative path,
 |      resolves it against base_path (bytes or str), and opens a file at that.
 |
 |      ELFFile uses functions like that for resolving DWARF links.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors defined here:
 |
 |  __dict__
 |      dictionary for instance variables
 |
 |  __weakref__
 |      list of weak references to the object
