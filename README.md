# B-Faultor

### Description : 

this project is a tool being used in a much bigger project **Fault Injection On Embedded Neural Networks**  we are in the level where we want to simulate the injections at the software level we are going to use this tool to inject faults like bit flips (EMFI) and instruction skips (Clock Glitching or voltage Clitching) and in pararel we are going to use QEMU to simulate a running trained model that calssifies photos using a simple `CNN` based model and the reaction of this model with respect to the applied fault in terms of the accuracy in order to try to evaluate some security paramters like confidentiality and DoS
